### Tasks:
-  Get a list of pairs from a configuration file.
-  Replace value1 by value2 for all non-overlapping matches in a given text file.
-  All values in configuration file are unique; no need to take care of preventing change of already changed value.
-  The names of both files must be passed as command line arguments.
-  Sort changed lines by the total number of symbols replaced, starting from the most changed line.
-  Output resulting text to console.

### Launch instruction:
- **configuration _file.txt** is used to store pairs with values value1 and value2.
- **text_file.txt** is used to store text in which you need to replace characters in lines and sort.

Let's say that the files **configuration _file.txt** and **text_file.txt** contain the data you specified.
Then to launch, you need to enter the command: **python replace_script.py configuration_file.txt text_file.txt**

You can use text files created by yourself in your work.
